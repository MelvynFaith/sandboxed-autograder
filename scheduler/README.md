# API Gateway & Job Scheduler

A Go service that exposes the REST and WebSocket API, queues grading jobs, runs the worker pool, and
persists results. It is **the only component that writes to PostgreSQL.**

**Owner:** Evan William
**Status:** not started. Sprint 1 target: authentication, profile, and course/enrollment APIs, with
schema migrations on staging.

## Responsibilities

- Serve the REST API under `/api/v1` with JWT access tokens and revocable refresh tokens, and serve
  real-time submission status over WebSocket with one-time tickets.
- Enforce object-level authorization. A request for another user's or another course's object gets
  `404`.
- Queue jobs behind the `JobQueue` interface. The in-process worker pool uses round-robin fairness
  per student and per-student rate limits.
- Run the grading harness once per submission, passing the assignment definition as a file path,
  never on the command line. Write all results in one transaction.
- Reconcile stale `RUNNING` jobs at startup and expose `/healthz`.

Schema migrations live in `migrations/`. Every up migration has a matching down migration.

## Build and test

To be added with the first implementation. CI activates the `scheduler` job once `go.mod` exists
here.
